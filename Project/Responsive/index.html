            <p>South Indian culture refers to the culture of the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
                Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. South Indian culture, though with its visible differences, forms an
                important part of the Indian culture. The South Indian Culture is essentially the celebration of the
                eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body and femininity.It is exemplified
                through its dance, clothing, and sculptures</p>

            <p>South Indian women traditionally wear the sari while the men wear a type of sarong, which could be either
                a white dhoti or a colourful lungi with typical batik patterns. The saree, being an unstitched drape,
                enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the
                navel of the Supreme Being is considered as the source of life and creativity.</p>

                Traditionally, South Indian men do not cover their upper body. Sometimes, in a formal situation, a piece
                of cloth may cover the upper body. Certain temples in South India even ban men from wearing upper-body
                garments when inside the temple. In Andhra and parts of north Karnataka, men wear kachche panchey where
                it is tied at back by taking it between legs. A similar pattern is seen in women. All over the
                peninsular coastal region, men wear coloured lungis and women wear saris in a manner of tying them at
                the back.</p>
